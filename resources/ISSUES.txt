How I'm collecting new "residential" units

1. All building permits for a time range (1 calendar year) are pulled
2. The permit types below are kept:
    'BNMRA': "New Multifamily 3-4 Units"	# Commercial Construction type
    'BNMRB': "New Multifamily 5+ Units"		# Commercial Construction type
    'BNCON': "New Other"			# Sometimes used for mixed use,  Commercial
    'BNRDX': "New Duplex"
    'BNSFR': "New Single Family Residence"
    'BNSFT': "New Single Family Townhouse"
    'BNROS': "New Shelter/Dorm/Etc"
    '':      "None specified" 			# Blank
    'None':  "None specified"
3. The filter works as follows:
a. MultiFamily:
	"Number Of Dwelling Units" >= 3 AND construction_type = "Commercial Construction" 

b. Single Family & Duplex
	subtype in the above list and dwellings >= 1


My proposed changes:
1. The "Number Of Dwelling Units" field should reflect the actual number of dwelling units,
  not carports, commercial units, etc.
  e.g. why would a duplex have 3 units?
  if you really want to count carports and business shells, don't use a res subtype

2. Not use BNCON for residential buildling types -- can count shell units

3. Maybe a new subtype is added ("BNCMU"?) used only for mixed use buildings; counts only DU


BNCON problems:

Potter Park 4-plex garages read as units
Sometimes mixed use buildings (e.g. Dearborn, Cambium Place, etc)


My model catches:
2016-MSS-COM-00086, "Custom Birdworks", 1 dwelling unit		-bad, shouldn't have DU
2016-MSS-COM-00135, "Dearborn Apts", 25 du			-good
2015-MSS-COM-00305, "Riverside Self Storage", 1 du		-bad, shouldn't have DU

Doesn't catch:
2015-MSS-COM-00357, "645 JOHNSON ST", SFR + New Duplex	-bad, should catch new units
BAARC -- Model does not currently gather this type
